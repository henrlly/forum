The integration of different AI modalities will be game-changing. We're already seeing early versions of this with models that can process both text and images, but I believe the next leap will be in real-time multimodal interaction. Imagine AI assistants that can see your environment, hear your voice, understand context from multiple sources, and respond appropriately across different media. This could revolutionize everything from education to entertainment to accessibility tools for people with disabilities.",
